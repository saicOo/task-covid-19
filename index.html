            <h2>TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS</h2>
            <h5>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.</h5>
            <p>However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
              hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
            <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms
              while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you
              have recovered.</p>

              <p>If you have mild symptoms, stay at home until you’ve recovered. You can relieve your symptoms if you:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rest and sleep</li>
                <li>Keep warm</li>
                <li>Drink plenty of liquids</li>
                <li>Use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Medical Treatments</h5>
              <p>If you develop a fever, cough, and have difficulty breathing, promptly seek medical care. Call in
                advance and tell your health provider of any recent travel or recent contact with travelers.</p>

              <p>People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by
                learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic

              <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting
                areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead
                to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in

              <p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about
                disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p>
              <p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease

              <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
                emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus
                that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

            <div class="answer-text">
              <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to
                a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                while other viruses are less so.</p>
              <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community

                have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became

            <div class="answer-text">
              <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href="#">spreading from person-to-person.</a> Someone who is
                actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are
                better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.</p>
              <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is
                made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and
                public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,
                illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
              <p>Current <a href="#">CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</a> is made on a
                case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:</p>
              <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications</p>
              <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
              <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24
                hours apart.</p>
              <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.

              <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
                emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus
                that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

              <p>From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</a></p>

            <div class="answer-text">
              <p>There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.</p>

              <p>Taking a hot bath will not prevent you from catching COVID-19. Your normal body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower. Actually, taking a hot bath with extremely hot water can be harmful, as it can burn you. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</p>

            <div class="answer-text">
              <p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>

            <li class="item">Are hand dryers effective in killing the new coronavirus?<i class="fas fa-plus"></i></li>
            <div class="answer-text">
              <p>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. </p>
