            <h2>TREATMENT FOR CORONAVIRUS</h2>
            <h5>To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.</h5>
            <p>However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
              hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.</p>
            <p>Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms
              while your body fights the illness. You'll need to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you
              have recovered.</p>

              <p>If you have mild symptoms, stay at home until you’ve recovered. You can relieve your symptoms if you:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Rest and sleep</li>

                <li>Drink plenty of liquids</li>
                <li>Use a room humidifier or take a hot shower to help ease a sore throat and cough</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Medical Treatments</h5>
              <p>If you develop a fever, cough, and have difficulty breathing, promptly seek medical care. Call in
                advance and tell your health provider of any recent travel or recent contact with travelers.</p>

                <p>People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by
                  learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic

                <p>People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting
                  areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead
                  to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in

                <p>Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is

                  disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.</p>
                <p>Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                  and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
                  emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus
                  that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                  (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to
                  a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                  person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                  while other viruses are less so.</p>
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community
                  (“community spread”) in <a href="#">some affected geographic areas.</a> Community spread means people
                  have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is <a href="#">spreading from person-to-person.</a> Someone who is
                  actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                  patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are
                  better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.</p>
                <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is
                  made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and
                  public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,
                  illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
                <p>Current <a href="#">CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</a> is made on a
                  case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:</p>
                <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications</p>
                <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
                <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24
                  hours apart.</p>
                <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may have close contact2 with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)</p>
                <p>Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:</p>
                <p>Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.</p>
                <p>Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.</p>

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how communities and caregivers can support those at higher risk is available on <a href="#">People at Risk for Serious Illness from COVID-19.</a></p>

              <li class="item">Should I wear a mask to protect myself?<i class="fas fa-plus"></i></li>
              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.</p>
                <p>WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (<a href="#">Advice on the use of masks</a>)</p>
                <p>The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.</p>

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

                <p>The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.</p>

                <p>Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.</p>
                <p>For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.</p>

                <p>Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).</p>

                <p>Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.</p>

              <div class="answer-text">
                <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>
                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>

                <p>From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands.

                <p>To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>

                <p>No. Hand dryers are not effective in killing the 2019-nCoV. To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. </p>
